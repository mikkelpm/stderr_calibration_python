    """Evaluates det A(lambda) at N equispaced points lambda on interval [0,2pi].

    A brief derivation of how this function uses FFT to rapidly evaluate det A(lambda) follows.

    We have, letting A_(-j) denote the k*k matrix A[-j,:,:]:

        det A(lambda) = det sum_(j=-(T-1))^(T-1) A_(-j)e^(i*j*lambda)
    
    which, flipping the order and realigning j, can be rewritten as

        e^(lambda*i*k*(T-1)) det sum_(j=0)^(2T-2) A_(-j+(T-1))e^(-i*j*lambda)   (***)

    Taking the sum in (***) for the values lambda=0,2*pi/N,...,2*pi*(N-1)/N, assuming N >= (2T-1),
    is just taking the discrete Fourier transform of the sequence A_(T-1),...,A_(-(T-1)),0,...,0
    right-padded with zeros to length N.
    
    Hence we can rapidly, simultaneously evaluate (***) at all points lambda equispaced from lambda=0
    to lambda=2*pi using the FFT. This is implemented below, with additional efficiency from fact that
    A(lambda) and A(2*pi-lambda) are conjugate.
